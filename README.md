# **KATARZYNA KRAUZA**

# 📊**Data Analyst**📊
I am comfortable working with numbers. I have been working in finance for over five years and actively investing in various assets for the past three. I enjoy taking on new challenges — both at work and outside of it. I'm developing my skills in data analysis within the IT field, while participating in running events as a way to build character and discipline—qualities that directly influence my approach to work.
