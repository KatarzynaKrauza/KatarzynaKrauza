# **KATARZYNA KRAUZA**

# **Data Analyst**

I am comfortable working with numbers. I have been working in finance for over five years and actively investing in various assets for the past three. Numbers are not just part of my job—they are my passion. I love analysing data, and it excites me both professionally and personally. I enjoy taking on new challenges and always commit fully to achieving the best possible results. Accuracy and quality are my priorities—half-measures are not an option for me.
